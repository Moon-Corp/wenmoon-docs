Ask

At the core of WenMoon's robust functionality is our integration with
Meteora's Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC). This advanced technology
provides significant advantages over traditional liquidity models, ensuring
fair and efficient token launches.
What is a Dynamic Bonding Curve? Unlike static bonding curves,
Meteora's DBC allows for customizable price dynamics and liquidity
distribution. This means we can:

• Adapt to Market Conditions: The curve can be configured to respond
dynamically to trading activity, offering better price stability and
reduced slippage, especially during initial launch periods.

• Enhanced Liquidity Provision: The DBC facilitates a more efficient and

flexible way for liquidity to be added and managed, ensuring a healthier
trading environment from day one.

• Wider Distribution via Jup.ag Partnership: Meteora's strong

partnership with Jupiter (Jup.ag) is a game-changer. This integration
ensures that tokens launched through WenMoon instantly benefit
from Jupiter's aggregated liquidity, giving them unparalleled reach
across the Solana ecosystem.

This integration is key to solving the discoverability problem for new
launchpads, ensuring your token gets seen and traded immediately.
